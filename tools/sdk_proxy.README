How to use the sdk_proxy shim to connect Microsoft Office's Excel + Powerpivot.

1) Office 2010 is required. Dowload the free powerpivot plugin for excel from www.powerpivot.com
2) Install and run plunkd on whatever platform you see fit. 
3) Using the splunkweb tool, set up splunk to index whatever it is you wish to index.
4) Using the splunkweb tool, create custom saved searches.

5) On the machine where the splunk python SDK is installed, create or modify ~/.splunkrc to set the
   credentials to access the splunkd server. For example:
host=127.0.0.1
user=admin
password=changed

6) run the sdk_proxy.py -- you should see something like:

splunk proxy: connect to http://localhost:8086/...

7) From excel, launch the powerpivot window.
8) From the powerpivot window, select "From data feed" which will launch a dialog.
9) For the URL, use the dns name or IP address of the machine running the shim. For example:

http://192.168.242.179:8086/Catalog/

10) This should initiate a connection to the shim, that connects to splunkd to return a catalog
    of all saved searches

11) In powerpivot you can select one or more saved searches to pull into powerpivot
12) You also have an opportunity to exclude certain columns from the final import.
13) When you click finish, the selected searches (and columns) will import the raw splunk event data 
    into powerpivot.
